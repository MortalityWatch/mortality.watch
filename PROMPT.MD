Please read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and implement Phase 6.

Setup:
- Create a new branch from `main` named `phase-6-[feature-name]`
- Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes

Implementation:
1. Review the implementation plan thoroughly and ask any clarifying questions before starting
2. Implement Phase 6 following existing code patterns and project conventions
3. Write or update tests as needed to cover new functionality
4. Update relevant documentation (README, inline comments, JSDoc, etc.)
5. Break work into logical, atomic commits with clear, descriptive commit messages

Quality checks:
6. Run `npm run check` - if it fails, fix issues and re-run until passing
7. Self-review your code for common issues (edge cases, error handling, type safety, etc.)
8. Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to mark Phase 6 as complete

Finalize:
9. Push the branch to remote
10. Open a pull request with:
    - Clear description of what was implemented
    - Reference to Phase 6 in the plan
    - Any notable implementation decisions or trade-offs
    - Screenshots/examples if applicable
11. Verify all CI checks pass - if any fail, fix and push updates
12. Notify me that the PR is ready for review

If you encounter ambiguities, blockers, merge conflicts, or need to make significant architectural decisions, pause and ask before proceeding.
